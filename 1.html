<h2>HTML이란 무엇인가?</h2>
<p><strong>I am an <u>explorer</u></strong>.
To force line breaks in a text, use the br<br> element.</p>
<img src="coding.jpg" width="100%">
<p>is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the 
    readable content of a page when looking at its layout. 
    The point of using <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/" target="_blank" title="html"> 슬기로운 의사생활 </a>슬기로운 의사생활 is that it has 
     more-or-less normal distribution of letters, 
     as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', 
     making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page 
     editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem 
     ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have 
     evolved over the years, 
     sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose 
     ( injected humour and the like).</p>
